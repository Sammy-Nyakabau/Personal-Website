Currently assisting Professor Danny Arlen de Jesús Gómez-Ramírez in his research on Artificial Mathematical Intelligence (AMI)

- the main goal of the research is the Creation of a Multidimensional Cognitive Artificial Intelligence being able to solve domain-specific problems using highly-technical mathematical models in (specialized sectors of) business, industry, as well as highly complex technical challenges involved in the development of (sustainable) cities, climate change and related issues. In particular, it will able to solve mathematical (and subsequently financial, economic and medical math-related) problems of any level of sophistication and to explain in a human-style way how such a solution was found in terms of the most important cognitive abilities our mind uses for abstract creation/invention
